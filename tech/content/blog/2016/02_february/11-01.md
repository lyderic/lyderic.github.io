I love busybox. It is super simple to compile, fully customizable. It even includes a web server! These are the steps I took to make it work, from source.

Make sure you have the following packages installed on your machine: git, gcc, make

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone git://busybox.net/busybox.git

Compile the source:

    $ cd busybox
    $ make deconfig
    $ make

If you have multicore, you can speed up compilation by running (for example if you have 4 cores):

    $ make -j 4

Once done, you have an executable called 'busybox'. Run it and you will see all the commands included. You run a command as follows, for example to open a vi text editor:

    $ ./busybox vi

Now, to run a web server, the command is called _httpd_. Each command has a short help, called with the --help switch. For httpd:

    $ ./busybox httpd --help
    BusyBox v1.25.0.git (2016-02-11 12:45:41 GMT) multi-call binary.
    
    Usage: httpd [-ifv[v]] [-c CONFFILE] [-p [IP:]PORT] [-u USER[:GRP]] [-r REALM] [-h HOME]
    or httpd -d/-e/-m STRING
    
    Listen for incoming HTTP requests
    
            -i              Inetd mode
            -f              Don't daemonize
            -v[v]           Verbose
            -p [IP:]PORT    Bind to IP:PORT (default *:80)
            -u USER[:GRP]   Set uid/gid after binding to port
            -r REALM        Authentication Realm for Basic Authentication
            -h HOME         Home directory (default .)
            -c FILE         Configuration file (default {/etc,HOME}/httpd.conf)
            -m STRING       MD5 crypt STRING
            -e STRING       HTML encode STRING
            -d STRING       URL decode STRING

So, you can  launch a web server for example like this:

    $ ./busybox httpd -p 8000 -h /path/to/www/pages

There are many more possibilities, including setting up mime types, running CGI scripts etc. [More information can be found on the OpenWrt wiki site](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/http.httpd) where the configuration file is explained in details.
