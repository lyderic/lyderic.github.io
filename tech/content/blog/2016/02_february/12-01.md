I have found out that it is possible to embed images in a HTML page as base64 strings! I like the idea of having everything as text. I use it to display the _favicon_ on the front page of my web site.

This is very easy:

Convert your favicon to base64:

    $ base64 -w 0 favicon.ico

The _-w_ switch is to have the whole string as a single line.

Include this entry in the _&lt;head&gt;_ section of your HTML page:

    <link href="data:image/x-icon;base64,AAABAAE...fAAD//wAA" rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" />

I cut the base64 string a little for better visibility.

Another cool use of base64.
